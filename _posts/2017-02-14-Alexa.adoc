==== Alexa Connections
Monitoring Alexa communications


    443/TCP - Amazon
    80/TCP - v4 & v6 Edgecast / Server Central / Akamai / s3-1-w.amazonaws.com 
        Alexa Skills hosted different places?
        Follow up - Quantify number of endpoints by typer per day
    123/UDP - v4 & v6 Amazon / pool.ntp.org?
    53/UDP - v4 & v6 Google Public DNS

Looking further into the 80 connections they are concentrated in a few ASNs. The spread across ISP and Corp space could hint at Alexa Skill based ASN whitelisting? ( If its possible to tie Skills to netblocks )
